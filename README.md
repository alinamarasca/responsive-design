Responsive design is a must nowadays.
Conquering responsive layouts by Kevin Powell is a nice way to train CSS skills and a real treat for curious mind.ðŸ§€ 
After brief explanation, students are given a small challenge every day, next day they can see Kevin's solution for the challenge.
I was really benefitial for me to take more time understanding some concepts and there is much more to come.
I am following the course with slight modifications, such as:
 - root variables ðŸ’™
 - css @import
 - planning to put more layouts on one page instead of removing them
